# Epistemic Provenance Results Path Configuration
#
# By default, the UI loads demo runs from /demo_results/epistemic_agent/
# Uncomment and customize VITE_RESULTS_BASE to load your local real runs:
#
# VITE_RESULTS_BASE=/results/epistemic_agent
#
# Note: If using local results, you must:
# 1. Generate a manifest: node scripts/make_runs_manifest.mjs
# 2. Ensure results are accessible via Vite's public/ directory or proxy

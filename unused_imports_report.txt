================================================================================
NOTE: This is a heuristic analysis and may include false positives.
Examples of false positives:
  - Imports used only in type hints or string annotations
  - Imports used via getattr() or eval()
  - Imports that define module-level behavior on import
  - Imports required for side effects
Manual review recommended before removing any imports.

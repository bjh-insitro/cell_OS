# Archived Status Reports

This directory keeps the historical status/summary documents that previously lived
in the repo root (e.g., `COMPREHENSIVE_STATUS.md`, `SIMULATION_PROGRESS.md`,
`HOUSEKEEPING_SUMMARY.md`, etc.). The most recent consolidated summary now lives at
`docs/STATUS.md`. Older snapshots remain here for reference and are named by date:

- `2025-11-28-comprehensive-status.md`
- `2025-11-28-project-status.md`
- `2025-11-28-simulation-progress.md`
- `2025-11-28-next-steps.md`
- `Documentation_Housekeeping_Plan.md`

When adding a new snapshot, drop it into this directory using the
`YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md` convention so the root stays clean.

    - "Longer staining time (last to be washed)"
    - "Higher signal intensity (more antibody binding)"
    - "Potentially over-fixed (harsh)"

  late_wells:
    - "Shorter fixation time (first to be washed)"
    - "Shorter staining time (first to be washed)"

# Notes for implementation
implementation_notes: |
  The EL406 serpentine pattern creates DETERMINISTIC temporal gradients:

  1. Processing order is fixed (A1 always first, P1 always last)
  2. Time delta between first and last well is ~4 minutes (384-well)
  3. This affects EVERY reagent addition step (fix, permeabilize, stain, wash)
  4. Cumulative effect: early wells are "over-processed", late wells "under-processed"

  Integration with Cell Painting assay:
  - Calculate well processing order from row/column
  - Compute time delta from A1 (reference well)
  - Apply time-dependent bias to stain factors
  - This is ADDITIVE to existing stain_cv (plate-level variation)

  Example: Well M23 (late in pass 1)
  - Processed at t ≈ 200s after A1
  - Gets 200s less fixation before wash → under-fixed
  - Gets 200s less staining before wash → lower signal
  - Apply ~8% negative bias to stain factor

  This gradient is LEARNABLE by agent:
  - Corner wells (A1, A24, P1, P24) show systematic bias
  - Agent can learn "A1 always runs hot, P1 always runs cold"
  - Combines with per-well biology to create well identity

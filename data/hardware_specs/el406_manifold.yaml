    notes: |
      Feeding 96/384-well plates creates temporal gradient:
      - A1 gets fresh media first (t=0), sits longest before incubation
      - P1/H12 gets fresh media last (t=60s for 96-well, t=240s for 384-well)
      - Early wells: Media cools slightly during dispensing (~1-2°C for 384-well)
      - Late wells: Get warmer media, less time for temperature equilibration

      Effects on biology:
      - Temperature shock differential (early wells experience more shock)
      - Nutrient availability timing (late wells get fresher state)
      - Growth phase synchronization disrupted by staggered feed

      Impact: ~2-3% CV contribution for routine culture, compounds with feeding gradients in Cell Painting

    cumulative_effect: |
      Gradients compound throughout experiment lifecycle:
      1. Plating: Initial cell seeding uses EL406 → density gradient
      2. Feeding: 2-3 feeds before assay → temperature/nutrient gradients
      3. Cell Painting: Fix, permeabilize, stain all use EL406 → signal gradient

      Total cumulative CV contribution: ~5-8% on top of per-well baseline
      Wells maintain consistent bias: A1 always "hot", P1 always "cold"

# Notes for implementation
implementation_notes: |
  The EL406 serpentine pattern creates DETERMINISTIC temporal gradients:

  1. Processing order is fixed (A1 always first, P1 always last)
  2. Time delta between first and last well is ~4 minutes (384-well)
  3. This affects EVERY reagent addition step (fix, permeabilize, stain, wash)
  4. Cumulative effect: early wells are "over-processed", late wells "under-processed"

  Integration with Cell Painting assay:
  - Calculate well processing order from row/column
  - Compute time delta from A1 (reference well)
  - Apply time-dependent bias to stain factors
  - This is ADDITIVE to existing stain_cv (plate-level variation)

  Example: Well M23 (late in pass 1)
  - Processed at t ≈ 200s after A1
  - Gets 200s less fixation before wash → under-fixed
  - Gets 200s less staining before wash → lower signal
  - Apply ~8% negative bias to stain factor

  This gradient is LEARNABLE by agent:
  - Corner wells (A1, A24, P1, P24) show systematic bias
  - Agent can learn "A1 always runs hot, P1 always runs cold"
  - Combines with per-well biology to create well identity

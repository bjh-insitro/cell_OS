# Stress-responsive gene programs for scRNA-seq simulation
#
# Each program defines differentially expressed genes per stress axis.
# Fold changes are program weights (saturated activation level), not absolute truth.
#
# These map to vessel latent states:
# - er_stress → er_stress program
# - mito_dysfunction → mito_dysfunction program
# - oxidative_stress → oxidative_stress program (if tracked)
# - dna_damage → dna_damage program (if tracked)

er_stress:
  # Unfolded protein response (UPR) markers
  up:
    HSPA5: 10.0   # BiP/GRP78 - canonical UPR marker
    DDIT3: 20.0   # CHOP - pro-apoptotic UPR
    ATF4: 5.0     # Transcription factor
    XBP1: 4.0     # Spliced XBP1
  down:
    COL1A1: 0.3   # Collagen synthesis suppressed

mito_dysfunction:
  # Mitochondrial stress response
  up:
    PARK2: 8.0    # Parkin - mitophagy marker
  down:
    ATP5A1: 0.25  # ATP synthase subunit
    COX4I1: 0.3   # Cytochrome c oxidase

oxidative_stress:
  # ROS response / Nrf2 pathway
  up:
    HMOX1: 12.0   # Heme oxygenase 1 - canonical oxidative marker
    NQO1: 8.0     # NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase
    SOD1: 2.0     # Superoxide dismutase
    GPX1: 2.0     # Glutathione peroxidase

dna_damage:
  # DNA damage response / p53 pathway
  up:
    TP53: 3.0     # Tumor suppressor
    CDKN1A: 10.0  # p21 - cell cycle arrest
    GADD45A: 8.0  # Growth arrest marker

transport_dysfunction:
  # Microtubule/cytoskeleton disruption
  # NOTE: In your current model, transport dysfunction is latent but may not
  # have strong transcriptional signature (morphological phenotype dominates).
  # Placeholder for now - can expand if you add transcriptional coupling.
  up:
    HSPA8: 2.0    # Stress-induced chaperone
  down:
    TUBB: 0.7     # Beta-tubulin (mild suppression)

proteostasis:
  # Proteasome inhibition / protein aggregation
  # Maps to er_stress axis in your current model
  up:
    HSPA5: 8.0
    DDIT3: 15.0
    SQSTM1: 6.0   # p62 - autophagy marker
  down:
    COL1A1: 0.4

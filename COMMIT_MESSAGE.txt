Add closed-loop QC mitigation cycles with epistemic rewards and strict integer cycle invariants

Implements minimal closed-loop agent capability that responds to spatial QC flags
with mitigation actions (REPLATE/REPLICATE/NONE) and computes epistemic rewards
based on QC resolution.

Key Features:
- Agent detects spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I) and chooses mitigation action
- REPLATE: Same conditions, new spatial layout (via layout_seed)
- REPLICATE: 2× replicates for increased power
- Reward tied to QC resolution (not accuracy)
- Deterministic with seed (layout variance via layout_epoch)

Cycle Semantics (CRITICAL):
- Mitigation consumes a full integer cycle (not subcycle)
- If cycle k is flagged, mitigation executes at cycle k+1
- Science resumes at cycle k+2
- No floats, no cycle reuse, strict monotonic progression
- Maintains temporal provenance for beliefs system

Implementation:
- New module: src/cell_os/epistemic_agent/mitigation.py
- Loop orchestration with pending mitigation state
- Agent decision methods (choose_mitigation_action, create_mitigation_proposal)
- World spatial layout variance (layout_seed support)
- Mitigation events logged to {run_id}_mitigation.jsonl

Guardrails:
- TypeError in BeliefState.begin_cycle() (survives -O flag)
- Assertion in loop (dev-time fast fail)
- Temporal ordering assertion (flagged_cycle < mitigation_cycle)
- Regression tests enforce integer cycle invariants

Tests:
- Unit tests: REPLICATE doubles wells, REPLATE changes layout
- Integration tests: Cycle invariants, monotonicity, sequence
- All tests pass
